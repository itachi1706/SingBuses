This is the Official Repository of the Bus Arrivals @ SG Android App. The main objective of this app was to provide bus arrival timings in
Singapore while at the same time, be able to send the data onto a smart wearable device. As of this moment, we are working on eventually providing Android Wear support  

Pebble App Support has been deprecated for a while and have since been removed in Version 4.5.0 of the application. It will still work if you use a version before 4.5.0

**This app uses Firebase Analytics, as such if you are meeting any crashes or errors related to it, make sure you have generated a google-services.json file from your Firebase project and add it to the app/ folder**

Releases are located [here](https://github.com/itachi1706/SingBuses/releases)

This application is not licensed under any open source license as of now until I feel the need to open source it. And the reason I don't feel the need to right now is because its incomplete and the code base probably sucks.
